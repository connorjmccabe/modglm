Description: This package computes interaction effects and their standard errors for logistic, Poisson, and negative binomial models. Effects are computed using cross-partial derivatives and discrete difference approaches described by Ai & Norton (2003) and by the accompanying manuscript to this package (McCabe et al., 2021). This package allows users to evaluate interaction functions conditional on user-specified values of predictors. It also computes interactions for each observation in the data row-wise, as well as the average interaction effect observed in the data.
